            <h2>Why Marseille?</h2>
            <h3>Marseille, a Mediterranean city at core</h3>
            <p>
              Marseille is the "oldest city in France" and indeed one of the
              oldest in western Europe. The city was founded as Massalia in
              around 600 BC, and soon developed into an important port in the
              ancient Greek world. For the Greeks, and later for the Romans, it
              was a major point of transition and trade between the
              civilisations of the Mediterranean, and those of Gaul and
              northwest Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that, essentially, has been Marseille's role ever since.
              Located near the mouth of the Rhone - the greatest natural
              corridor between the Mediterranean and the lands to the north, it
              has long been one of the most important, when not the most
              important, port in France - a role that explains its importance
              and its size, as France's second largest urban area, to this day.
